This repository is a PyTorch implementation of [ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02147). 
This code is  based on 
- The official [**Torch** code](https://github.com/e-lab/ENet-training) by the [authors](https://github.com/e-lab) of the paper;
- The unofficial[ **Caffe** code](https://github.com/TimoSaemann/ENet) by [TimoSaemann](https://github.com/TimoSaemann);
- The unofficial [**PyTorch** code](https://github.com/vietdoan/Enet_Pytorch) by [vietdoan](https://github.com/vietdoan).
